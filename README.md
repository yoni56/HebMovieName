# HebMovieName
Translate [Moridim](https://moridimtv.com/) movies name from English to Hebrew.

Small automation I wrote for my dad when downloading movies from Moridim. Instead of manually copying the hebrew title from the website and renaming the local file, this program automates it.

# How to use
Copy the program to the directory with all movies and execute.
